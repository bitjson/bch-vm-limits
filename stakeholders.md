The goal of the [Cash Improvement Proposal (CHIP) process](https://blog.bitjson.com/bitcoin-cash-upgrade-2023/#why-chips) is to coordinate upgrades to Bitcoin Cash without a central authority by developing proposals in a collaborative, public process.

**CHIP maintainers are expected to actively seek out stakeholders and demonstrate widespread ecosystem approval.**

This includes approval from node and virtual machine implementations, wallets, and other open source software projects, educational institutions and community initiatives, and industry actors like exchanges, miners, services, and other businesses.

The following statements have been submitted in support of this CHIP.

> The VM Limits CHIP retargets Bitcoin Cash's Denial-of-Service limits to extend compute for real contracts by more than 100x while reducing worst-case node compute usage by 50%. By reducing overhead, the retargeted limits simplify contracts, reduce transaction sizes, streamline contract audits, and improve overall security.
>
> By improving contract efficiency, this upgrade also makes important use cases more practical, including post-quantum cryptography, stronger escrow and settlement strategies, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and other crucial innovations for the future security and competitiveness of Bitcoin Cash.
>
> Finally, this upgrade raises the bar by contributing new tooling and a cross-implementation benchmarking methodology to continuously verify node performance. Beyond empirically verifying the safety and correctness of the upgrade, these tools will simplify development of new production-ready implementations, prevent regressions in existing implementations, and reduce the cost of verifying implementation-specific software updates.
>
> I'm confident in the extensive cross-implementation testing and verification performed for this CHIP, and I recommend activation in Bitcoin Cash's 2025 upgrade.
>

> I, Calin Culianu, believe the VM Limits and BigInt CHIPs should be included in the BCH upgrade for May 2025.
>
> I was excited about the VM Limits CHIP from at least February of 2024 and began considering it and trying out toy implementations of the earlier version of the CHIP since then. I subsequently worked with Jason a great deal with lots of back and forth in order to evolve the design, and I'm very confident in the final VM Limits CHIP design and rationale. I believe it will unlock a lot of extra capabilities for smart contracts on BCH, as well as plug some performance holes in terms of worst-case performance.
>
> In short: As a result of working on the VM Limits implementation for BCHN, I came to deeply understand its design and rationale and definitely endorse it. I think it is very well thought out and the idioms and costing concepts it invents give us new "knobs" to turn should we decide to turn up the script execution engine limits in the future. It is the right design, and it can take us into the future.
>
> Additionally – The BigInt CHIP came up as an offshoot of the VM Limits work. I believe bringing ~80k-bit integers to BCH script is a huge step forward as it unlocks many previously-impossible contract capabilities. While working on a proof of concept implementation of this CHIP, I was shocked at how fast BigInts are and how low the performance cost for allowing them truly is. It's a no-brainer in my mind to add this additional BigInt CHIP. What's more, VM Limits + BigInt work perfectly together and the costing scheme involved in VM Limits keeps the BigInt changes constrained, so no contract can abuse BigInts to create "poison" transactions or blocks that overuse CPU or memory when validating.
>
> As a Bitcoin Cash developer with many years of experience in this space, I endorse both the VM Limits and BigInt CHIPs for the upcoming May 2025 upgrade to BCH.

> The re-targeted VM Limits CHIP solves a real, pressing problem for BCH smart contract developers while also improving the network's security by preventing some worst-case malicious contracts. The research and testing that went into this CHIP is of outstanding quality and sets a standard for future proposals to aspire to.

> I fully support the `CHIP-2021-05-vm-limits: Targeted Virtual Machine Limits` proposal for Bitcoin Cash. This upgrade enables more advanced, efficient smart contracts by removing outdated restrictions while maintaining safeguards, allowing contract authors to focus on application logic rather than working around the limits.
>
> The increased stack element size, revised operation cost system, and targeted hashing limits are well-reasoned improvements enhancing BCH's capabilities without compromising security or performance, and the extensive rationale, benchmarks, and risk assessment provide confidence in its design.
>
> This upgrade is a crucial step in BCH's evolution as a powerful, flexible cryptocurrency platform, and I'm looking forward to designing contract systems leveraging these new features!

> —<cite>Josh Green ([@joshmgreen](https://x.com/joshmgreen/status/1844052791255499140)), [Bitcoin Verde](https://bitcoinverde.org/)</cite>

> This proposal will unlock the next generation of smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash. Incredibly it unlocks Ethereum-level complexity with no sacrifice at the alter of global state. This will be a huge competitive advantage for Bitcoin Cash in the coming years. The conservative approach to the new limits along with the thorough benchmarking, risk assessment and documentation leave no doubt that we can safely adopt this CHIP in May, and I support doing so.
>
> While the VM Limits proposal unlocks Ethereum-level complexity on Bitcoin Cash, our developer experience (DX) must aim for simplicity. That includes straightforward manipulation of numbers, regardless of their size and without a need for libraries or extra operations. This BigInt proposal will deliver a simple and powerful DX with no compromise on security or performance and I therefore support its adoption."

> As a BCH builder and CashScript developer, I wholeheartedly support the VM limits and big integer upgrades proposed by Jason Dreyzehner. These changes are crucial for expanding Bitcoin Cash's smart contract capabilities and improving overall network efficiency.
>
> The density-based limits and removal of arbitrary number size restrictions will enable more complex on-chain applications, benefiting projects like [TokenStork.com](https://tokenstork.com/) and opening new possibilities for CashScript development. The rigorous testing and community-driven approach to these upgrades instill confidence in their implementation.
>
> I believe these enhancements will significantly contribute to Bitcoin Cash's growth as a versatile and powerful Web3 network, aligning well with the goals of increased Bitcoin adoption and usability that drive projects like [BitcoinCashSite.com](https://www.bitcoincashsite.com/).

I have no concern with my node's ability to keep operating effectively, and expect that projects I contribute to will be able to take full advantage of these improvements.
>
> Though a long period of discussion, it appears all major concerns I've seen have been addressed. Frankly, from all I've read, these limits are rather conservative!
>
> The massive work put in by Jason Dreyzehner, Calin Culianu, and bitcoincashautist is inspiring. The attention to detail, time put into addressing concerns, running massive testing suites, etc. I hope to see both CHIPs locked in November, and activated in 2025!

> I formally support activation of the following two CHIPs for the Bitcoin Cash (#BCH💚) 2025 upgrade cycle:
>
> - CHIP-2021-05 VM Limits: Targeted Virtual Machine Limits
> - CHIP-2024-07 BigInt: High-Precision Arithmetic for Bitcoin Cash
>
> These two CHIPs dramatically increase the power of the BCH Script engine, while also making it significantly more efficient.
>
> The VM Limits CHIP implements a new script budgeting system that maximizes the resources available to a script without introducing any new worst-case scenarios or DoS vectors.
>
> This allows contract developers to reduce the complexity of their scripts while also affording them increased power and flexibility. Despite the increased flexibility, these scripts do not negatively affect the BCH economic model, as the budgeting system is measured against a standard P2PKH transaction as a baseline for worst-case validation times.
>
> The companionate BigInt CHIP enables the script engine to operate on integers of any magnitude (hundreds or thousands of digits). This allows contract and wallet developers access to bleeding-edge crypto technology such as quantum-resistant wallets, zero-knowledge-proof verification, and on-chain encryption.
>
> The benchmarking suite that was developed to R&D this CHIP is also quite impressive: it thoroughly tests every possible combination of arithmetic opcodes in order to prove that worst-case transaction validation times are not negatively impacted by the changes proposed in this CHIP.
>
> Overall, this CHIP (which started research in 2021, with the BigInt CHIP ending up as a "freebie" thanks to the new budgeting system) has a very clear analysis of benefits, risks, and implementation costs. On behalf of myself, [Selene Wallet](https://selene.cash/), [bch.ninja](https://bch.ninja/), and [XULU.TECH LLC](https://xulu.tech/), I couldn't be more excited to endorse activation of these two CHIPs for the November lock-in.

> I'm often humbled by the big brains in the #BitcoinCash space. When asked to submit my 0.00006 #BCH on the proposed 2025 CHIP for VMLimits & BigInt, I thought; I'm in no way qualified to weigh in on such matters. From a tech/dev perspective, I truly am not!
>
> Then, I realized that it's not JUST about the tech...it's also about timing, striking while the iron is hot and doubling-down on the #BitcoinCash momentum we're seeing happen right now! This is something I DO know a lot about, having single-handedly built a business from the ground up and seizing opportunities in a timely manner when they presented themselves.

> It might just be me, but I can't help feeling like we're at the dawn of some really big things with #BitcoinCash. For that reason, and FWIW, I fully support the 2025 CHIP for VMLimits & BigInt (bonus👊). I think NOT capitalizing on this opportunity (that's been three years in the making) will come with bigger opportunity costs than the low-risk of moving ahead NOW with this thoroughly vetted CHIP in May of 2025!

>
> As a native BCH smart contract focused company, we expect the two proposals to enable simpler, more secure and more powerful uses for BCH as programmable money, in line with a streak of useful BCH Script upgrades that started in 2022. We are already seeing infrastructure preparations to take advantage of this in the work such as [Cashscript](https://flipstarter.cashscript.org/en), and we expect more projects to come online in the months to come.

> The Bigints proposal was announced later than most other CHIP precedents in a barebones form, which did cause concern for us as we expressed in our previous [assessment](https://read.cash/@GeneralProtocols/general-protocols-assessment-on-frontrunner-bch-chip-proposals-august-2024-fdf6de1d). We are nonetheless impressed by the rapid pace of its progress and the rigorous discussions that has taken place since our last assessment. The Bigints proposal integrates well with the VM-Limits CHIP, and both proposals would be in poorer shape without the other. In our opinion both CHIPs have met the bars for rigor established in previous years, and are now in sufficiently good shape for inclusion together.
>
> This endorsement shall not be taken as an endorsement for latecoming proposals in general: Circumstances around the Bigints CHIP was extraordinary, and correspondingly extraordinary efforts were made to secure it in time both technically and socially. We believe we have contributed our share in offering constructive scrutiny through the process, and would like to see the bar remain high in terms of robustness and timeliness for future CHIPs.

Not only will the CHIP improve contract development on BCH, it will also improve network security against malicious contracts. The community reception, review and initial statements have been very reassuring. We look forward to experimenting with what new possibilities this enables for future Guru contracts!

> The current VM Limits have been a sometimes difficult constraint for contract development on BCH. The new VM Limits proposed are sensibly calibrated such that it gives BCH far greater (and, very often, more efficient) scripting capabilities while ensuring no additional cost beyond the current worst-case scenarios already present in BCH's VM. Both the VM Limits CHIP and the BigInt CHIP have my full support for a May 2025 activation.

> Visionati approves of both CHIPs. We feel they will be an excellent addition to BCH and allow script writers much needed flexibility to extend BCH functionality.
>
> —<cite>[Visionati](https://visionati.com/)</cite>

> The CashScript compiler has been one of the main tools through which BCH contract developers encounter the current, overly restrictive VM limits. The implementation of the 'Targeted VM Limits' CHIP will significantly reduce this pain point, providing much-needed flexibility without compromising the security or scalability of the network.
>
> For BCH contract developers, the most immediate limit will shift from the current 201-opcode limit to the 1650-byte input size standard rule. This CHIP effectively expands the capacity of smart contracts to include approximately ~10x the number of opcodes or ~3x the byte size.
>
> We are excited to eliminate the 201-opcode and 520-byte limits from the CashScript compiler, empowering BCH contract developers to experiment with and build more powerful and innovative smart contracts.

> By enabling greater flexibility in smart contract design, BCH is positioning itself as a testbed for risk-on features, similar to how Litecoin led the way with Segwit before Bitcoin. It’ll be interesting to see how BCH developments are adopted in the crypto space.

> These proposals are net positives for Bitcoin Cash. By removing outdated restrictions, they’re giving developers the freedom to create the next generation of BCH dapps with greater efficiency and security. That’s obviously a win for users too.

Despite CHIP-2024-07-BigInt's late introduction, both of them have matured as of October 2024, and are receiving widespread support from the community.

> The Bitcoin Cash Node team was intimately involved with implementing and testing both proposals. **The maintainers can now confidently say that these CHIPs seem to be in sufficiently good shape, and worthy of our endorsement.**
>
> We have additionally erected a temporary server at https://index.imaginary.cash with Fulcrum port at 50006, which will serve as a testing ground for post-activation contracts until the proposals' likely activation on Chipnet this November. Anyone interested in preliminary tests is welcome to use this facility as well.

### Disapprove

The following statements have been submitted from individuals and organizations that disapprove of this CHIP.

> The ideas look very good and clearly intend to make the capabilities next gen, which is great. The proposal is lacking in the parts where we can understand the actual impact to scaling and operations.
>
> There isn't any wall-clock analysis to that should be front and center on the risk-assessment side. Without putting in the hours ourselves it is nigh impossible to figure out how long it will take to validate transactions or blocks that push the boundaries of what is allowed.
>
> We can't approve it without such basic analysis, but giving a vote of disapproval is also too far, the benefits are great. Maybe we'll see a report on actual impact (linking to data) before the May upgrade. That would be ideal.

**Maintainer Response**: Please see [Tests & Benchmarks](./tests-and-benchmarks.md) and also note the 10-100x node performance safety margin described in [Risk Assessment: Expanded Node Performance Safety Margin](./risk-assessment.md#expanded-node-performance-safety-margin).

### Neutral

The following statements have been submitted from individuals and organizations that abstained from approving this CHIP.

> I validated the overall [MR 1891](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/1891) for the VM Limits and BigInt CHIPs with the updated LibAuth and benchmark scheme. I performed benchmarks and executed the test plan. After that I [shared my results](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/1891#note_2138753900) with the BCHN development team, everything looks good and results match expectation (and my CPU is apparently 30% faster than from Calin ^^).
>
> Although I'm not the expert of the BCHN code source, everything does seems to work as expected eventually and compiling now also works without any warnings. Despite not having the deeper knowledge about the technical implementation of the CHIPs, better performance is always very welcome! Specifically in favour of the reduced transaction sizes; same for reduction of storage as well as CPU usage reduction. I'm running a full node after all.
> _Disclaimer:_ I didn't yet run production or load testing with the latest CHIPs. If I find any regression, I will report it via GitLab / Slack.
